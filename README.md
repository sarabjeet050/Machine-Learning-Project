Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing test time optimization modelling

Reduced the time Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench by optimal algorithms that will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.
•	Performed basic EDA for dataset using Pandas.
•	Removed those variable(s) for any column(s), with the variance is equal to zero i.e. constant.
•	Checked for null and unique values for test and train sets.
•	Applied the label encoder for ordinal columns using sklearn.
•	Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA.
•	Predicted the test dataset using XGBoost and its various hyper tuning parameters for trained model.
